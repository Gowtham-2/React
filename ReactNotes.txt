React Hooks internally use a linked list data structure to manage the state and effects associated with each component. Here's why:
1. Preservation of Order:

Hooks rely on the order in which they are called within a component. This order is crucial for React to correctly associate state and effects with their respective hooks.
A linked list maintains the order of elements naturally, ensuring that the hooks are tracked in the same sequence as they were declared.

2. Dynamic Nature of Hooks:

Unlike class components, where state and lifecycle methods are defined upfront, hooks allow for a more dynamic approach.
You can conditionally add or remove hooks within a component, depending on the situation.
Linked lists are efficient for insertions and deletions compared to arrays, making them ideal for this dynamic behavior.

3. Performance Considerations:

While arrays are generally faster for accessing elements by index, linked lists excel in scenarios where insertions and deletions are frequent.
In the context of React hooks, the order of hooks is more important than random access, making linked lists a suitable choice.

4. Implementation Details:

React's internal representation of components (known as "fibers") uses a linked list structure to store the hook data. This design choice allows React to efficiently manage the state and lifecycle of components, especially in complex and deeply nested component trees.


Linked list are better in traversal, insertion and deletion operation than the arrays which help virtual dom to manipulated states and components.
